            ## Python linting (`black`) is failing
            To keep the code consistent with lots of contributors, we run automated code consistency checks.
            To fix this CI test, please run:
            * Install [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): `pip install black`
            * Fix formatting errors in your pipeline: `black .`
            Once you push these changes the test should pass, and you can hide this comment :+1:
            We highly recommend setting up Black in your code editor so that this formatting is done automatically on save. Ask about it on Slack for help!
            Thanks again for your contribution!
